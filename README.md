# 🌦️ Weather App using React JS

## 📘 Project Overview
This **Weather App** is built using **React JS**. It allows users to check the **current weather** of any city, state, or country using the **OpenWeatherMap API**.  
The app displays key weather data such as:
- 🌡️ Temperature

You just need to **enter the city name**, and the app fetches accurate weather details in real time.

Would you like me to include **screenshots section with placeholders and styling preview (like card style UI)** too? That can make the README more professional visually for GitHub recruiters.
